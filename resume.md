As a product-focused Software Engineer, I build simple, effective solutions for complex challenges. Known for a direct, hands-on approach, I bridge the gap between high-level business strategy and the practical details of shipping robust code. My expertise spans from pitching investors and architecting foundational platforms (Auth, IoT, Blockchain) to accelerating development with modern tools like Cline and Claude Code. I thrive on solving real-world problems and building products people love and value.
