Today I received a new Ledger Nano S and it left quite an impression on me, so much that I needed to share it with the world: First of all, compared to the Ledger Nano (Bitcoin only), this thing is huge, heavy and ugly. Sure, even the Ledger Nano wasn't a beauty, but for 86 Euro (incl. Shipping) the S could have looked a little sharper.

Beauty aside, my primary concern is the secure storage of crypto currency, and the Ledger Nano (S) is supposed to do this well. Aside from Bitcoin, the S currently supports Litecoin, Ethereum (+ Asset Tokens like Melonport), Ethereum Classic, Dodge, Dash, Strais, ZCash and XRP.

## Impressions

### Build quality

The Ledger Nano S is nothing to go crazy over. It looks like a 2000-era USB stick with 16MB memory. While the casing is made of plastic, the metal cover does add some strength and covers display and USB port.

### Initial Setup

Compared to the Ledger Nano, the setup on the S feels archaic. In fact, you'll find yourself spending a lot of time dealing with the tiny display and two buttons on top.

Here's how it goes down:

1. Plugin the device, enter and confirm pin (up to 8 digits)
2. Copy your passphrase word by (click) word from the display
3. Download [Ledger Manager](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/apps/manager) - Chrome app
4. Manually delete and reinstall all apps to ensure they are up to date

Now it hit me: Out of storage - What? I had just installed two additional coin apps, to support ZCASH and DASH, but it won't take the third, STRAITS. There's no indication of remaining space - thoughts?

**Update:** Apparently the ST31H320 ARM core and flash memory has only 320 Kbytes of memory. That means, the number of apps you're able to install on the Ledger Nano S is limited.

### Official apps

Before you can access your crypto apps, you will need to install the corresponding application: [Ledger Waller Ethereum](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/apps/ethereum) for Ethereum and Ethereum Classic and [Ledger Wallet](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/wallet) for all remaining, officially supported coins.

At first sight, Ledger applications are great: Easy to use, responsive, well designed and open source.

#### Ledger Wallet Ethereum

### Usage

This is where it becomes awkward. Let's try to accomplish two easy tasks, and see where it takes us.

#### 1) Check Bitcoin balance

1. Plugin the device
2. Enter your PIN on the device (tiny buttons), everyone can see
3. Select the Bitcoin app on the Ledger Nano S
4. Launch the Chrome App Ledger Wallet Bitcoin
5. See your balance

#### 2) Transfer Ethereum

Now we're still in the Bitcoin app

1. Close the Chrome App
2. Close the Bitcoin app on the Ledger Nano S
3. Launch the Chrome App Ledger Wallet Ether app
4. Select the Ethereum app on the Ledger Nano S
5. Send Ethereum, confirm on Ledger Nano S (there's no real 2FA)

PIN entry aside, Why is this so complicated? I'd like to see a unified interface that presents me with all accounts and coins that are stored on the Ledger Nano S - like a portfolio, like Exodus!

Looks gorgeous, doesn't it? That's what I want for my Ledger!

## Additional Apps

I've found additional apps for the Ledger Nano S. There's even an early beta of GPG and 2FA ala Google Authenticator. Cool stuff!

- Komodo (via Ledger Manager)
- SSH/GPG Agent (via Ledger Manager)
- Password Manager (via Ledger Manager)
- Open GPG (via Ledger Manager)
- [OTP 2FA App](https://parkerhoyes.com/bolos-apps) (HOTP 2FA)
- [Snake App](https://parkerhoyes.com/bolos-apps)

## Comparison

### Ledger Nano

- BTC only
- Get [Ledger Wallet](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/apps/bitcoin) to access BTC
- Launch app, enter pin, done!
- Companion app [Ledger Authenticator](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/apps/bitcoin#get-the-apps) as 2FA for mobile
- or Security card 2FA
- You don't need a USB cable

### Ledger Nano S

- BTC, LTC, ETH, ETC, ZEC, XRP
- Get [Ledger Manager](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/apps/manager) to install apps to manage currency
- Get [Ledger Wallet](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/apps/bitcoin) to access BTC/ALT
- Get [Ledger Wallet Ethereum](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/apps/ethereum) to access ETH/ETC
- Get [Ledger Wallet Ripple](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/apps/ripple) to access XRP
- Custom Apps (Fido, U2F, [GPG](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-app-ssh-agent), [SSH](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-app-ssh-agent))
- Screen 2FA (no real 2FA) *[1]*
- You need a USB cable

I wish the Ledger Nano S was a little more like the little brother, with integrated USB, a lot smaller and equipped with 2FA companion app Ledger Authenticator.

*[1]* Unlike the Ledger Nano, the S allows you to confirm transactions on-screen. That means, if someone gets hold of your Ledger Nano S, incl. PIN, consider your money gone. I preferred doing this without display, using either the security card or companion app (just feels better).

## Roadmap

The [public roadmap](https://trello.com/b/5nQ1mdzt/ledger-roadmap) gives us a good idea what's to come:

- A Chrome App replacement based on Electron is in the works (since [end of 2016](https://trello.com/c/mf0aFgDK/28-chrome-applications-end-of-life))
- Ledger Wallet Android is in Alpha, more on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/47bti4/ledger_wallet_android_spv_alpha_release/) (no updates since [early 2016](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-wallet-android))
- Monero support received a lot of votes

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">By (massive) popular request, Ledger is going to announce XRP Ripple support for Nano S &amp; Blue in the coming days. Stay tuned! <a href="https://t.co/SadUkoZtus">pic.twitter.com/SadUkoZtus</a></p>&mdash; Ledger (@LedgerHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ/status/864395677475930112">May 16, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

**Update:** Support for XRP has been added.

## Final words

Overall, it's sort of like an MP3 player, before Apple made the first iPod. It does the job and keeps your crypto secure but I hope the new Electron based software they are working on, will collect the different cryptos under one roof.

Get one!
