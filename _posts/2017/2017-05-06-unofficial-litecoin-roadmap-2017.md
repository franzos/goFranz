~~I've come to realize that there's no public roadmap of what's to come over the next couple of months, so I've put together what I've found around the internet as well as on the last, [official roadmap from 2016 (pdf)](/assets/content/2017/litecoin-roadmap-2016.pdf).~~

**Edit**: The official Litecoin roadmap has been published on [litecoincore.org](https://litecoincore.org/).

Because a lot of this tech was initially meant for Bitcoin, there are only few articles that specifically mention Litecoin. Fortunately, the tech behind these two coins is relatively similiar, so Litecoin users can now, with minimal porting, take advantage of many of the features that have originally been designed for post-SegWit Bitcoin.
