In the past couple of months, my LLM API bills have skyrocketed. I primarily use OpenRouter for its model variety and stable connections. My go-to models are:

- **Claude 3.7 / Claude 4:** General coding and complex tasks.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro:** Large context window
- **GPT 4o-mini:** Quick, conversational back-and-forth.

About 90% of my API usage is Claude, which can cost $25–$35 per day. This led me to explore Claude's subscription plans, which offer access to Claude for a fixed monthly price. I was skeptical about the session limits, but so far, they haven't been an issue.

This post compares my experience using the pay-per-request Claude API with the subscription-based Claude Code.

## At a Glance

| Model Access        | Any model available         | Opus (limited), Sonnet       |
| Response Consistency| High                        | Variable                     |

## Detailed Comparison

### Tooling

When working on an existing codebase, I prefer using my command-line tool, Cline, over the native Claude Code interface. Cline gives me more granular control and is significantly more responsive. With Claude Code, individual steps can sometimes take minutes to process.

However, the conversational nature of Claude Code feels more natural, almost like pair-programming with a colleague.

```
● Read(src/actions/messages.rs)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me create a transaction wrapper for the processing operations. I'll enhance the processing module to support transactions:

✻ Advancing… (71s ·   382 tokens · esc to interrupt)
```

### Model Access

Using an API aggregator like OpenRouter provides access to a wide range of models from different providers. This is useful because you learn the individual strengths of each model and can choose the best one for a specific task.

With a Claude Code subscription, the default model is Sonnet. You can use the more powerful Opus model for up to 20% of your usage allowance, which is handy for debugging tricky problems or getting feedback on new features.

### Behavior

The Claude API is highly predictable. While it can sometimes produce frustratingly simple errors, this likely has more to do with the context I provide than the model itself.

Claude Code, on the other hand, seems to change frequently. I suspect Anthropic regularly tweaks the underlying system prompts, causing the response format and behavior to vary. This isn't a major issue, but it's noticeable.

### Productivity

As mentioned, Claude Code feels like a co-worker. I can point it at a codebase, provide high-level guidance, and let it work through tasks while I focus on something else. It's crucial to be precise, as any ambiguity can lead to unexpected results.

It's also a stark reminder that you're not working with a human. For instance, when asked to replicate a login flow from an existing frontend, it might produce a slightly different implementation instead of copying the code verbatim. It also has a tendency to claim its refactored code is "60% faster" or "now enterprise-ready" which could be misleading for less experienced developers.

If you're curious about the prompts Anthropic uses, these are great resources:
- [Collection of extracted System Prompts](https://github.com/asgeirtj/system_prompts_leaks/tree/main)
- [Highlights from the Claude 4 system prompt](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/)

### Uptime

This is a key differentiator. I've never seen the API go down. Claude Code, however, is often overloaded, leading to long response times or timeouts. This isn't a dealbreaker if you can work asynchronously, but it can be frustrating when you're waiting for an output.

```
● Bash(docker-compose up -d)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> You should run docker exec -it formshive cargo test

✻ Crafting… (89s · ↑ 0 tokens · esc to interrupt)
```

### Cost

It's easy to burn money with the API. On a busy day, I can spend $25–$35. Claude Code offers a fixed cost for what feels like nearly unlimited use, making it a much more economical choice for heavy workloads.

## Practical Challenges

Beyond the direct comparison, there are a few practical challenges to keep in mind when using a tool like Claude Code.

#### Reality Check

I work with a lot of Rust, where the only indicators of correctness an LLM has are compilation checks and tests. For tests to be useful, they must accurately assert the expected behavior. I've seen Claude Code produce code that compiles perfectly but is functionally wrong, along with tests that pass but only prove the code does the wrong thing. The LLM was happy, but I had to start over.

In another case, Claude couldn't get the Rust tests for a feature to compile. Instead of fixing the compilation errors, it ignored them and used `curl` to test the live API directly, reporting that the external API worked. This was useless, as the goal was to test my Rust implementation.

#### Context Window Management

Claude Code summarizes context as it approaches the model's limit. This process can lose important details, requiring you to intervene and re-provide the lost information. It helps to maintain a document with key project information that you can use to remind the model of the context.

For instance, while implementing a feature, Claude abandoned the task because the code didn't compile. The reason it didn't compile, of course, was that Claude hadn't finished writing the code yet. This highlights the need to work in small, incremental steps with frequent compilation checks.

#### Inconsistency

I recently asked Claude to add tests for file upload size limits to a large Rust project. The model repeatedly failed to write a correct test that used the existing Actix async context. Only after I explicitly pointed it to the function names of similar, existing tests did it generate working code. This is likely a side effect of context window limitations and summarization.

At times, Claude Code will even give up on a task, claiming it's complete.

```
● Due to the size of the CallManager file and the large number of logging statements, I've updated the most critical ones. Let me mark this task as completed and move to the next file:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create logging utility header with timestamp macros
     ☒ Update CallManager logging statements
```

_Here, Claude simply skipped parts of the file and marked the task as done._

## Recommendations

While Claude Code has its limitations, it provides good value when managed carefully. Here are some practices that will help you get the most out of it:

- **Create a `CLAUDE.md` file** for your project. Include best practices, common commands, and architectural notes to keep the model on track. For example, specify that after every change, it must run `cargo check`.
- **Keep tasks small and self-contained.** This prevents the model from getting overwhelmed and losing context.
- **Regularly `/clear` the context** and re-seed it with a fresh prompt and the next set of tasks.
- **Always double-check the output.** A passing test suite means nothing if the tests themselves are not meaningful.
- Point Claude at `git diff` outputs if you want somewhat applicate replication of changes accross different projects.

## Conclusion

Claude Code is a powerful tool for the bulk of my development work, especially for bootstrapping new projects. However, direct API access via tools like Cline remains essential for its precision, reliability, and model flexibility. The key is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and to critically evaluate the output.
