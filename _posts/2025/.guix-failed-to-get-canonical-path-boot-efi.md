If you're running into this error reconfiguring your GNU Guix zcat system after a fresh installation:

```bash
... grub-install: error: failed to get canonical path of `/boot/efi'
```

Here's a quick fix:

- Find your EFI partition name; for ex `nvme0n1p1`
- Create a mount point if it doesn't exist: `mkdir /boot/efi`
- Mount the partition: `mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /boot/efi`

Now you can reconfigure your system:

```bash
guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm
```

I don't have time to dive into it right now, but if it happens again, I'll probably file an issue.
