## What is DGX?

DGX is an Ethereum based cryptocurrency backed by physical gold stored in Singapore. That means, 1 DGX = 1g (99.99 LBMA) gold which, at the time of writing, is valued at $43.24 USD or 0.1157 ETH.

The advantages are huge:

- Unlike other cryptocurrencies DGX is backed by a physical assets
- Unlike USDT (backed by USD), DGX has no fractional reserves
- DGX can be stored on virtually any Ethereum compatible wallet
- Unlike gold, it's very easy, fast and cheap to transfer DGX
