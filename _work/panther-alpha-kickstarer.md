A Kickstarter campaign in November 2016 had raised a total of $43,858 before we've decided to cancel and postpone it ~~indefinitely~~.

**Update: 2019-01-20**

Panther Alpha is back on track and will be better than ever planned. With dedicated hardware and a specifically developed OS **PantherX**, we're going above and beyond what we've planned.
