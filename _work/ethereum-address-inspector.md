## The challenge

Learning Vue.js by writing my first application based on the JS framework.

[Preview on Heroku](https://ethereum-address-inspector.herokuapp.com/) / [Source code](https://github.com/franzos/ethereum-address-inspector)

_* Heroku may take up to 30s to respond on initial load (free dyno)_

## What I did

- Implemented etherscan.io API for wallet transaction history
- Implemented coinmarketcap.com API for exchange rates (EURO/USD/ETH)
- Used Burma framework for layout and styling
- Hosted on Heroku
