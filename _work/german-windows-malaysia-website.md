## The challenge

The German Windows Website has long been suffering under high exit rates, broken links and a imperfect mobile layout.

## What I did

The latest 2017 website refresh turned the German Windows website not only completely static but mobile-first. Unlike the already fast, previous site, the new website is no longer powered by a CMS (content management system) but just plain .html files.

{% include project-image.html caption="April 2017, Homepage" image="q-windows-08.jpg" %}

{% include project-image.html image="q-windows-09.jpg" %}

A modern, mobile-friendly audio player allows desktop visitors to compare the noise level of various German Windows glazing solutions under different environmental conditions.

This section works like a technical catalog: All window and door types are listed with their individual configuration options.

{% include project-image.html image="q-windows-14.jpg" %}
{% include project-image.html image="q-windows-12.jpg" %}

The contact form connects directly to the German Windows Pipedrive CRM account. All submissions automatically show up on their internal dashboard and a custom tracking plugin allows German Windows staff understand where leads came from and what pages they looked at.

## The effects

The website is not only a lot easier to maintain, but also a lot faster. Page load time is down by 65% and time spend browsing is up by 25%.
