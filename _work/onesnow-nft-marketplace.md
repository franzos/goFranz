### Website technology

OnesMarket is a handcrafted NFT marketplace that enables users to mint, buy and sell NFTs to (initially) users in Thailand and China. The market is integrated with the ONES ecosystem, and all KYC-verified ONES users can take advantage of SSO-login. The market backend is written in Typescript and integrates a private Ethereum-based blockchain for issuance, and IPFS for NFT asset storage.
