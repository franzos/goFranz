Nostr is a protocol that enables a censorship-resistant, global social network.

## The challenge

To learn the Nostr protocol, to implement a Nostr Typescript library, on top of which to develop a Nostr web client, with the ultimate goal to have some fun and learn more browser tech.

You can preview the current release here: [nostrop.com](https://d2okqj4v2u9fts.cloudfront.net/).

All code, including:
- Common, Node and Web library
- Node client
- React web client (with Zustant)

can be found at [github.com/franzos/nostr-ts](https://github.com/franzos/nostr-ts)

## Thoughts

I'm not big on social media, so I hardly ever use Nostr, but this has been a great experience nevertheless; It's amazing what the browser can handle, if you know how-to offload stuff.

If you want to know more, I've written about Nostr here: [Hello Nostr](/blog/hello-nostr/). You might also want to checkout the "official" Nostr [Website](https://nostr.com/) - there you'll also find loads more clients, for every platform under the sun.
