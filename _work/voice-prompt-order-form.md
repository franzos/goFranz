## The challenge

Develop an effective, modern, one-page voice prompt order form for voice recording studios all over the world.

[Source code](https://git.sr.ht/~franz/voipy-form)

{% include project-image.html image="voice-prompt-order-form-01.jpg" %}

## What I did

- Order form based on Vue.js
- Enabled use of template for easy prompt selection
- Calculation based on words, prompt count and extra services
- Multi-currency enabled (manually updated rates)
- Used Bulma framework for layout and styling
- 100% plain HTML (no server required)

This form is now in use on the [On Air Website](/work/onair-website/).
