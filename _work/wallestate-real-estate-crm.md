## The challenge

A user-friendly, not-more-than-necessary, time-saving, real-estate CRM.

## What I did

- Market research, budget
- Initial mockup of CRM
- Investor presentation [> download PDF (3.3 MB) <](/assets/files/wall-estate-investor-presentation.pdf).

## Mockup

#### All properties in one place

{% include project-image.html image="wall-estate-03.jpg" %}

#### The built-in CRM

The build-in CRM matches contacts with in-house and external properties, based on the client's preferences.

#### Manage a busy day

Keep track of appointments and estimate travel times between meetings.

#### Market

Opt-in, shared, worldwide real estate database that promotes faster sales and commission sharing.
