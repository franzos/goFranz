## Introduction

Khone Alman (translated: German House, Deutsches Haus) is a German restaurant and delivery service with a selection of tranditional German, Persian and International menu items.

## The challenge

This website came with a number of challenges:

- Easy online order with individual sides selection
- No back-end: Transmission of order via Email
- Referral system: Track referrals by other customers
- Multi-currency: Pay in cash, wire transfer or loyalty points
- Multilingual: English, German, Persian

Allow customers to easily order online. This includes individual wishes such as different sides, sauces and even the style of cooking (rare, medium, well-done).
