<u>My Name is Franz Geffke</u> - I was born and raised in East Germany but today my home is anywhere between Europe, the Middle-East and Southeast-Asia. New experiences and culture draw me to travel to, and live in different countries all around the world - With stronger foreign ties come a different, new perspective on all aspects of life and business which I continue to embrace.

Apart from my travels, I'm a privacy advocate and supporter of technologies and ideas that help promote personal freedom, decentralize certain aspects of power, and are easily accessible to everyone - now or in the near future.

Whenever I'm not working, I like to disconnect and return a different era - with crackling vinyls, glowing amplifiers and tennis.

Here's what I'm reading: [Bookshelf](/bookshelf/)

## Work

I’m a full-stack engineer with 12+ years of experience delivering secure, scalable systems across industries and continents.

My technical expertise includes:

- **Authentication & Security:** OAuth2/CIBA identity services, and mobile ID
- **Blockchain:** Crypto exchanges, NFT marketplaces, and smart contract systems
- **IoT:** Health monitoring platforms, real-time gateways, and device integration
- **Web & Mobile:** Responsive applications using modern frameworks

I focus on solutions that solve concrete problems and create lasting value—using technology as a tool, not an end in itself. My background spans everything from hands-on coding to leading development teams for clients from early-stage startups to international organizations.

__Here's how I can help your organization:__

- Architect and deploy secure, production-scale systems
- Build authentication and identity solutions
